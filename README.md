We had to build a web app using JavaScript, that was the project. At first I wanted my game to be like the Top Trumps card game, but it turned out to be something else, I would say for the better for this has more functionality than what a Top Trumps card game would have.

### [](https://github.com/chrynx/wdi-project-1#challenges-faced)Challenges faced

I had a bit of a tough time trying to sort out the bars and the switch (by the way, there's a surprise waiting for you once (if) you beat The hoff! <a href="https://github.com/chrynx/wdi-project-1">PLAY NOW TO FIND OUT!</a>.

To deal with the problem, I had to think outside the box (see what I did there?), no? , because I used flexbox?... *ahem* anyways... YES! I did use flexbox to help me manage how the bars would move and to make everything easier to manipulate. With the switching of characters, I used a constructor function to make it more manageable and future proof, if ever I want to add more characters into the mix.

### [](https://github.com/chrynx/wdi-project-1#finishing-statement)Finishing Statement

I will be adding more features to this project (as no project is really finished), the following are the things that I can imagine would be nice to add to it:

<h5>For equality sake, all pronouns are to be known as "submarine"</h5>
<i><h6>Did you just assume the gender of my submarine?</h6></i>

- Adding a feature where the player can choose who submarine plays as.
- The player being able to set submarine's own stats.
- A more advanced AI (SKYNET anyone?).
- Have a survival mode (where the player gains points to add to submarine's stats as submarine beats opponents of increasing difficulty.
